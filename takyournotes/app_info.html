        <p style="font-family: 'Maiandra GD'; padding: 20px;">Hi! This is munna, the app creator. I made this app because mental health issues in teenagers are mainly
            due to an extended amount of school work. While I cannot change that, I do hope that I can help by making
            this app.

            <br><br>
            there are many features that this app offers such as:
            <br>
                1. Pomodoro Timer: This is a timer that many students use to help them with their time management <br>
                2. Note Pad: When a student has quich thought and needs someplace to jot it down, they write in the note Pad <br>
                3. To-do list: Most students find it very helpfull to have a to-do list on hand <br>
                4. Notes Maker: This is a place like MS Word where you can write word documents. Many students like having everything in one place; therefore, we added a place to write school notes as well. <br>
                5. Notes Finder: Many students struggle with certain concepts. Therefore, we made a space where people can publish their notes so other students can review them for more clarity on certain topics. <br>
